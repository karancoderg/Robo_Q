# Google OAuth Authentication Fixes

## Problem Summary
Users were being automatically signed out when trying to place orders after logging in with Google OAuth. This was causing a poor user experience where authenticated users would lose their session during critical operations.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Token Refresh Issues**: Google OAuth tokens were not being properly refreshed when expired
2. **Aggressive Logout Behavior**: API interceptors were redirecting to login on any 401 error
3. **Insufficient Authentication Validation**: No pre-flight authentication checks before critical operations
4. **Missing Session Persistence**: No mechanism to maintain user sessions across page reloads or API calls

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Google OAuth Token Handling
**File**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Improved `loginWithGoogle` function to ensure both access and refresh tokens are properly stored
- Added error logging for better debugging
- Enhanced token validation with null checks

### 2. Improved API Response Interceptor
**File**: `src/services/api.ts`
- Modified response interceptor to be less aggressive about redirecting to login
- Added checks to prevent redirects when already on auth pages
- Improved token refresh logic with better error handling
- Added proper handling for missing refresh tokens

### 3. Enhanced Authentication Context Initialization
**File**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Added comprehensive error logging during auth initialization
- Improved token refresh flow during app startup
- Better handling of edge cases where tokens exist but are invalid

### 4. Pre-flight Authentication Checks
**File**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` & `src/pages/Checkout.tsx`
- Added `checkAuthStatus()` function to verify authentication before critical operations
- Integrated authentication verification in checkout process
- Added proper error handling for expired sessions during order placement

### 5. Enhanced Protected Route Component
**File**: `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`
- Added double authentication verification for critical routes (checkout, orders)
- Improved loading states and authentication flow
- Better handling of authentication state changes

### 6. Session Persistence Mechanisms
**File**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Added storage event listeners to detect token removal
- Implemented periodic authentication checks for Google OAuth users (every 5 minutes)
- Added session monitoring to prevent unexpected logouts

### 7. Better Error Handling in Order Placement
**File**: `src/pages/Checkout.tsx`
- Added pre-order authentication verification
- Improved error messages for authentication failures
- Better handling of 401 errors during order placement
- Graceful fallback to login page when session expires

## Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow Improvements
```typescript
// Before: Simple token storage
localStorage.setItem('accessToken', accessToken);
localStorage.setItem('refreshToken', refreshToken);

// After: Enhanced token storage with validation
localStorage.setItem('accessToken', accessToken);
if (refreshToken) {
  localStorage.setItem('refreshToken', refreshToken);
}
```

### API Interceptor Enhancements
```typescript
// Before: Aggressive redirect on 401
window.location.href = '/login';

// After: Smart redirect with page checks
if (!window.location.pathname.includes('/login') && 
    !window.location.pathname.includes('/register')) {
  window.location.href = '/login';
}
```

### Pre-flight Authentication
```typescript
// New: Authentication check before critical operations
const isAuthenticated = await checkAuthStatus();
if (!isAuthenticated) {
  toast.error('Please log in again to place your order');
  navigate('/login');
  return;
}
```

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Seamless Order Placement**: Users can now complete orders without unexpected logouts
2. **Better Error Messages**: Clear feedback when authentication issues occur
3. **Automatic Token Refresh**: Transparent token renewal without user intervention
4. **Session Persistence**: User sessions maintained across page reloads and API calls
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Smooth fallback to login when authentication fails

## Testing Results

- ✅ **Build Status**: All TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ **Google OAuth Login**: Working correctly with proper token storage
- ✅ **Order Placement**: No more automatic logouts during checkout
- ✅ **Session Persistence**: User sessions maintained across browser refreshes
- ✅ **Token Refresh**: Automatic token renewal working properly
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error messages and fallback behavior

## Files Modified

1. `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Enhanced authentication logic
2. `src/services/api.ts` - Improved API interceptors
3. `src/pages/Checkout.tsx` - Added pre-flight auth checks
4. `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - Enhanced route protection
5. `GOOGLE_OAUTH_FIXES.md` - This documentation

## Deployment Notes

- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- All existing authentication methods (email/password, OTP) remain unchanged
- Google OAuth flow is now more robust and reliable
- Users will experience seamless authentication without unexpected logouts

## Monitoring Recommendations

1. Monitor authentication error rates in production
2. Track token refresh success/failure rates
3. Monitor user session duration and logout patterns
4. Set up alerts for authentication-related errors

The Google OAuth authentication issue has been comprehensively resolved with multiple layers of protection against unexpected logouts while maintaining a smooth user experience.
